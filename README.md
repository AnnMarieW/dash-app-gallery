# Dash App Gallery

This app gallery is designed for people new to Plotly and Dash.  It contains simple sample apps
with ~150 lines of code to demonstrate basic usage of components, callbacks and layout design.


- Search for code examples. For example, search for "dcc.Dropdown" and you will see only
 apps containing dropdowns.
- Select an app to see it live with the code side-by-side.
- See more information including links to tutorials and dash documentation.
 
### This app is supported by the Dash Community!
