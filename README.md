# Dash App Gallery

## See it live at:

https://dash-example-index.herokuapp.com/


This Community App Gallery is designed for people new to Plotly and Dash.  It contains minimal sample apps
with ~100 lines of code to demonstrate basic usage of graphs, components, callbacks, and layout design.

### Navigating the Gallery:
1. To get started, use the search field to search for any keyword you're interested in. For example, search for "dcc.Dropdown" and you will see only
 apps containing dropdowns.

2. Select an app to see it live with the code side-by-side. At the lower part of each app, you will find links to tutorials and Dash documentation.
