Thank you for your contribution! If this PR is for adding an example app, we greatly appreciate your efforts!

**A Quick Note on Our Review Process**
We wanted to give you a heads up about our review process. Once an app meets our initial [requirements](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dash-app-gallery/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#requirements-for-new-apps), it undergoes an extensive and detailed code review to ensure the project maintains its high quality and consistent coding style. You can find all the details in our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/AnnMarieW/dash-app-gallery/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

**How Would You Like to Be Involved?**
To make the process as smooth (and painless) as possible, please let us know how you'd like to participate in the code review process: (Please check one)
- [ ] **Actively Involved**: I’d like to be actively involved during the review process. The app will be merged after we all agree on any changes.

- [ ] **Review Updates**: Please make the necessary changes and I'll review any updates. If you don’t hear from me, it’s OK to merge if the app meets all the requirements.

**Response Time and Inactivity**
Our goal is to respond to PRs and issues promptly. Any issues or PRs that are inactive for longer than a month will be automatically closed unless other arrangements are made.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. We look forward to collaborating with you!
